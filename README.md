# Ironhack project 7 Forest Cover Type clustering

![GitHub Logo]()

### Project description

In this project the goal was to build a model to predict values or classes for any dataset, and implement in a way a step of clustering/unsupervised learning. I choosed to work with a dataset about forest cover type and build a model to predict classes of tree from their other features, and compare models with and without a step of clustering to reduce the number of features. I also tried to cluster the whole dataset and visually compared the result to the actual classes.
